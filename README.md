# NIflex

This package contains a series of wrapper-, helper-, and plotting functions that together make up a flexible workflow for downloading data from the database for the Norwegian Nature Index and using it to calculate the Nature Index for different ecosystems, pre-defined thematic indices to publish alongside the Nature Index, modified Nature Index products for use in Ecological Condition Assessments, and fully customizable Nature Index products.

To install {NIflex} please use the following code (you might need to install the remotes package first).
